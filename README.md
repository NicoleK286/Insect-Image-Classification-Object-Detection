# Insect-Image-Classification-Object-Detection

Insects are a diverse group with over 120 Taxonomic orders and about 1.3 million species of Arthropods. They are an important part of the ecosystem and play diverse roles as pollinators, pests, and food sources. Several repositories like iNaturalist and Project Noah use citizen observations to track wildlife movements from birds to insects and animals. There are some insect identification applications, but these are not as widespread or well. Google Lens is often the only application that can offer species or family-level identification of insects for researchers. Hence, there is a need for better insect identification programs. The aim of the project is to build an insect classification algorithm that can correctly classify insects into their taxonomic order.
